Chët Andersen Just what is consciousness then?

And how can anyone talk about atoms having consciousness?

Chët Andersen
Tom Trinko there are two kinds of pan psychism. One is where the atoms carry a little bit of consciousness each and everyone. The other is where consciousness is fundamental, and atoms are created from the consciousness. I don’t believe either of these, so it’s going to be hard for me to defend them.
For me, I’m convinced the consciousness is the process of being aware of things. That means consciousness is a process, and it only occurs in a system capable of carrying on that process. So individual atoms don’t have consciousness. But if you have a system that is capable of sensing and responding to its environment, then you can have varying degrees of consciousness.

Tom Trinko
Chët Andersen I think we agree that saying that atoms are conscious is silly.
However a robot which just follows its instructions isn't conscious in any meaningful way is it?
Otherwise we'd have to say that a doorbell is conscious because it senses pressure and responds by ringing a bell.

Chët Andersen
Tom Trinko the doorbell example is not sense and respond. Let me see if I can explain. You need something that exhibits homeostasis, that is it can measure (sense) the environment and then take an action to counter the change. Sweating in response to being too hot is the simplest case I can think of.
Theories around how homeostasis works center on the free energy principle, which to work, the system exhibiting homeostasis must have an internal model of the external environment. It is from this model that consciousness arises.

Tom Trinko
Chët Andersen So a thermostat is conscious since it senses the house getting too cold and turns on the furnace to change the environment?
And is our sweating a conscious act?
How does consciousness arise from a model? After all all computer simulations have models of the environment that they're simulating built in but I doubt you'd say that the programs meteroligists use to predict the weather are conscious.
I get your defending something you don't believe in but in this case I don't see that what you're defending is defensible without completely changing the meaning of the word conscious.

Chët Andersen
Tom Trinko Essentially, yes, the thermostat/furnace/house together as a system is the absolute smallest "bit" of consciousness. Remember, consciousness exists at varying degrees, and this "bit" is some small it is incomprehensible what it means.
I think we have a grasp of how intelligence can be varying degrees, and how a wasp for instance has some intelligence, but not much. It is hard for us to imagine very low degrees of consciousness. But who are you to say the wasp is not conscious?
The "feeling of being hot" is the conscious aspect of regulating body temperature. You no doubt have felt at times that you were hot?
I don't know "how" consciousness arises from that model in the same way that I don't know "how" gravity causes the earth to attract the moon. What the science hopes to show is that whenever certain properties of a system exists, there also exists consciousness.
This is not panpsychism by the way. Above I describe some theory of consciousness promoted by notable neuroscientists and I don't know the name of this theory at the moment.

Given the definition of "consciousness" one would need to redefine the word to apply it to a thermostat/furnace system.
Why would we think that an insect is conscious in the sense that you and I are conscious?
However as I understand the theories you don't agree with but are describing the problem isn't insects it's individual subatomic particles having consciousness isn't it?
Hawking has shown that true consciousness, the ability to make choices, is impossible for a purely natural system:
Hawking made the following argument:
1) We are purely material beings
2) In that case all our thoughts are brain chemistry
3) But chemical reactions are controlled by the laws of physics not by us
That led Hawking to conclude:
It is hard to imagine how free will can operate if our behavior is determined by physical law, so it seems that we are no more than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion.
Hawking, Stephen; Mlodinow, Leonard. The Grand Design . Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
So there is no way for science to show that our consciousness arises from purely material elements.
Neuroscientists have no falsifiable theory about consciousness and to the best of my knowledge they haven't shown any error in Hawking's reasoning.
Rather they seem to just assume that we are purely material beings, as Hawking does, and conclude that since we are purely material and we are conscious then consciousness must arise from purely material mechanisms.

Tom Trinko // the definition of "consciousness" one would need to redefine the word to apply it to a thermostat/furnace system.//
First, I would not expect a dictionary to be the place to find out deep philosophical truths about the universe. instead what you find there is "typical" use by people who speak the languange.
Second, you don't have to, because basically a thermostat is "awake and aware of it's surroundings" if you accept that minimal consciousness is a very very tiny part of what we normally consider consciousness.
I am quite sure individual subatomic particles don't have any consciousness.
While I respect Hawking a lot, he was a physicist and not an expert on consciousness. None of his 3 points contradict this theory. I am happy if you would present a different theory of consciousness, but citing "one guy" that disagrees will get us nowhere.
//hard to imagine how free will can operate//
Free will is a broken concept the way philosophers define it, and certainly does not exist. But we were talking about consciousness, not free will. Free will is not needed for consciousness. The problem is that Hawking was not really aware of the nuances of the consciousness debate -- because he was not an expert.
Theists have no falsifiable theory about consciousness. I am waiting for you to propose an alternative to what I posted.
//then consciousness must arise from purely material mechanisms.//
I am OK with that.

Tom Trinko
Chët Andersen But the dictionary is the place where we find out what words mean isn't it?
Hence if one wants to talk about something that isn't what the dictionary says is consciousness we need to use a different word for it don't we?
I don't know of anyone who would say that a thermostat is awake.
Hawking presented a proof based on physics. I don't see that you've shown an error in that proof.
Just how can we have the ability to make choices if all our thoughts are the result not of us but of the laws of physics?
So if free will doesn't exist you didn't choose to respond to me right?
We have souls so we can make choices.
The proof of that is in your own thoughts which show that you do make choices.
So until you can prove that your own thoughts are illusory the data shows that we aren't purely material beings.
Once again consciousness can't arise from purely natural means since all natural means are controlled by physics.
You need to show how the laws of physics lead to one's ability to make choices don't you?

Chët Andersen
Tom Trinko These are good questions.
I am a little surprised at your simplistic view of words and dictionaries. A dictionary records the most common meanings from a majority of speakers. But for abstruse topics, people tend to develop esoteric vernacular also called jargon which is understood only by that particular in-group. We are on a profound and arcane topic which the common person has not considered deeply, and for which common words may or may not exist. Surely you have read philosophers like Kant for which words have very special meanings that are not exactly in the dictionary, and in some cases are forced to use German phrases (like "'ding an sich`). If you limit yourself to meaning found in the dictionary, there are some things you simply can't say.
No, the common dictionary definition of consciousness is NOT what I am talking about.
//I don't know of anyone who would say that a thermostat is awake.//
Indeed, this is a very erudite concept. On the face is seems absurd, and it incorporates a very special meaning / understanding that is not in the dictionary and not in common parlance.
// if free will doesn't exist you didn't choose to respond to me right?//
Wrong. I did choose to respond. You do have thoughts and you do determine your actions as well. But that is not free will. We have self-determination. We have minds, and those minds are in the world, and our minds determine what we do. When we make a choice, our actions are determined by our needs and desires -- which is actually what you "want" to do.
Free will on the other hand is the ability to do something that is not determined at all by anything. That is, you could do something that you don't "want" to do. This is an old concept from philosophers who had no idea how a mind might exist in the world. I fear without the necessary background you might also have a hard time understanding how a mind works in the world.
We are physical beings, and as such, our thoughts are real physical things. We really do make choices, but we do so with minds that obey the laws of physics. If I had the ability to control 10^25 atoms individually, I could change the thoughts in your head, and make you have different thoughts, and there is nothing you could do about it.
//So until you can prove that your own thoughts are illusory//
Thoughts are not illusory. They are real, concrete, physical things. Thoughts are processes that obey all the natural laws. Your memories are physical as well. You brain collects memories of what you do and do not like, and those physical things are used by the mind to make real decisions.
What evidence do you have that thoughts and memories are not real physical things?

Tom Trinko
Chët Andersen If we don't use dictionary definitions in common conversation then intelligent communication isn't possible.
Neither of us are academics speaking in an academic context so we should us the common definition of words when we try to communicate shouldn't we?
As a physicist I understand the issue of jargon which is why when I talk to non-physicists I use the common definition of words not the technical one.
As I heard Feynman once say it's fine to simplify so long as one doesn't say something that isn't true.
If you're not using the dictionary definition of "consciousness" then you need to use another word to avoid confusion don't you?
I'm not aware of philosophers who would say that an inanimate object, such as a thermostat, is awake.
How is you choosing to answer or not answer me not an example of free will? And clearly our actions are determined by us since we often choose to do things that aren't best of us because they are good for those we love.
And just what is this "mind" you're talking about. How is it the product of purely natural processes?
Free will, once again in common usage, is the ability for us, not our bodies following their genetic programming, to make choices. As you've defined it it's impossible since it would require us to make decisions with no inputs what so ever.
Please prove your claim that we are only physical beings. As part of that proof explain why if we are our thoughts show that we make decisions which Hawking has proven is impossible if we are purely material beings since in that case our thoughts are chemical reactions in our brains which are controlled by the laws of physics not by us, our conscious selves.
If our thoughts are real and they show that we do make choices and Hawking has proven that purely physical beings can't make choices doesn't that prove that we aren't purely physical beings?

Chët Andersen
Tom Trinko //Free will, once again in common usage, is the ability for us, not our bodies following their genetic programming, to make choices.//
Genetics has nothing to do with your day to day choices, but instead your environment and experience through your memories is what determines your choices.
//Free will, . . . as you've defined it it's impossible//
I refer you to this definition of Free Will: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/
Or if you prefer a more theistic explanation: https://www.theopedia.com/libertarian-free-will
These are not my definitions, nor are they necessarily what you find in day-to-day conversation. These define a type of free will that is logically inconsistent in my mind: they are impossible.
Perhaps are more modern treatment with the same conclusion is found here: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83817782-determined
Hawking was saying free will is impossible, and I agree.
Hawking did not "prove" that we "don't make choices". Scientists don' prove anything -- that is for mathematicians. He never said we don't make choices, he said that our choices are determined. Big difference.

Tom Trinko
Chët Andersen If we lack souls, if we are purely material, then all our actions are based on our genetics and our experiences. Other than those things what controls our thoughts if we are purely material beings?
On free will your source says:
"The term “free will” has emerged over the past two millennia as the canonical designator for a significant kind of control over one’s actions."
But as Hawking has shown if we're purely material creatures we have no control over our actions. Hence my use of "free will" is correct.
How can one "make choices" if one's choices are predetermined?
And I don't see that you've reconciled the fact that your thoughts show that you do make choices with the idea that you don't.



Chët Andersen
Tom Trinko The confusion arises from a misunderstanding of what "you" are. You have a worldview that you are separate from your body. That is, your body is your body, and you are the soul that somehow inhabits that body. This separation of you from the universe then causes you to reject the idea that "you" could be caused by the universe.
My view is a non-dualist view that says we are actually part of the universe, not separate from it. As a part of the universe, my actions and my entire being are intimately integrated with everything else.
I still feel like I am somehow separate and on my own, however this is an artifact of the way understanding has to word: to understand my part of the universe I need to artificially draw a line between "me" and "other" and all understanding comes from the comparing and contrasting these two. That gives an illusion of separation.
To understand what is really happening, we have to let go of thinking of the universe in terms of "things" and understand that everything is a relationship. That is, everything is relative to everything else. If you look carefully, you will see echoes of this in the teachings of Jesus before the religion got political.
I do make decisions. I decided to write this. However, my writing is completely limited by that knowledge. I can not write something that I don't know. I am free to write whatever I WANT to write. But what I WANT to write, is mediated by my memories.
But wait a minute. Who caused my memories? I didn't. But still I OWN my memories. They are mine. They are me. Thus, when I write something based on my memories, I am really choosing to write, and I am choosing what I write, even though my memories were determined by my past experience. I am a part of the universe, and I do make choices, even though everything is determined by the laws of physics.
As a dualist, you reject the idea that material beings can have consciousness because you have an ASSUMPTION that you are separate from material and that material can't do things as complex as thinking. We can't "feel" ourselves think, so thinking appears to us to be separate from the universe. This is an illusion. I leave you with these questions:
Can you say a word that you don't know?
Can you talk about a city that you don't know about?
Free will says that you are completely free to say and talk about anything, even things that you have not learned about.

Tom Trinko
Chët Andersen Actually I have pointed out that your thoughts show that you make decisions.
So not only have I presented evidence that our thoughts aren't determined you haven't shown that they are determined have you?
But let us assume that our thoughts are determined. What does that make us other than mindless puppets?
It's often said that "we are our choices" so if we make no choices what are we?


Chët Andersen
Tom Trinko I agree that thoughts are real and actually make decisions.
You have not shown any evidence that decisions are not determined. When you make a decision, you find a "reason" for the decision. If I suggest you poke your eye out with a pen, I can predict reliably that you will say "no" because there are many reasons that you need your eye, and it would be a very bad decision to choose to poke it out. That decision is determined.
Even if I ask you to choose your dinner from a menu, you will come up with a "reason" for the choice. Even if your reason is to flip a coin, that decision is determined.
We are not mindless puppets. We are have minds. And those minds really do make decisions, but the decisions are determined by your NEEDS and DESIRES. You have zero control over those.
Let me try to explain why this is still important. Say you have decided to go to work every Monday morning. When Monday comes around it might be sunny, or it might be dark and rainy, or it might be snowy. Here is the important point: no matter what the weather is like, YOU will still take whatever steps are necessary to get there. You will put on the right clothes. You will scrape the windshield is necessary. You are not just a puppet to the wind and rain. You actually have goals and desires and you actually act on them.
However, the desire to have a job is complicated, but it is not entirely free. There are many good reasons why you choose to have a job, and they are all determined (in this case much because you want to maintain a certain social status which is itself a complicated concept). Your decision to go to work on Monday morning will act and overpower the random flow of events in the universe. You will have an effect.
What you have to understand is that you are an EMERGENT feature of the universe. That is you consciousness is real and it came into being at one point. While most of what material does is very short term bouncing around, your emergent consciousness can link intentionality across years, and can have a real effect on the universe, even though your needs and desires are determined. Does that help make sense?
As succinctly as you can, explain: "why can't consciousness be determined?"
