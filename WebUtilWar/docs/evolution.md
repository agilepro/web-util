QUESTION:
According to Atheist we were created by something without a brain

ChÃ«t Andersen
self-organization is seen in the universe in many forms. Nobody denies that a tree grows all on its own (given light, water, air, and nutrients). Nobody denies that a baby animal grows all on its own (given nourishment which is not a "cause"). Nobody denies that a hurricane grows on its own without the need of a brain. Nobody denies that a canyon or a valley forms all on its own given precipitation and flowing water. Nobody denies that a star forms all on its own.
What the creationist fails to understand is that ecosystems and the parts that are played in the ecosystem can grow on their own without a brain. Evolution grows the form of animals all by itself in the way that a tree grows all by itself. A tree doesn't need a brain. Evolution does not either.
