Question:

I would like to understand why young earth creationists think that god goes to such lengths to make the world look old.

It is certainly possible that god created the world last Thursday with all the history and all the appearance of being much older.  Creationism is like last-Thursdayism except it is 6000 years instead of 1 week.

With millions of fossils categorized, and thousands of layers of rock identified, there is no disagreement:  the world LOOKS exactly as if it was 4 billion years old and that life evolved slowly over that time laid down in rock layers that formed over 4 billion years.

Creationists: why do you believe god wants to deceive humanity?  Is it an elaborate joke on the non-believers?  Why would god make the world LOOK different than it really is?  Why does god need to fool the evolutionists with an elaborately detailed story will literally millions of facts pointing to a specific history?   Why must humans -- particularly those who spend the time to become expert -- be deceived in this way by God?

Chët Andersen, Ever heard of the Isle of Surtsea? Do you know its significance for geological dating?

By way of a specific example of rapid geomorphological development, we may refer to the volcanic island of Surtsey, off Iceland, which was produced during an eruption covering the period November 1963 to June 1967.

Within a period of months this sterile, virgin rock was transformed into a ‘mature’ island with beaches, pebbles, sand, vegetation and many other features which would superficially suggest great geological age.

Anthony McNally But the fact is that it does NOT look old excepted in a superficial way that no geologist accepts.

When I say the Earth looks old, I mean that using the best geologic techniques, it really appears old, not that in some superficial wanna-be creationist way of squinting and saying it looks sorta like another island that is really old.

Geologists know that the earth was formed through a series of processes that have been running for 4 billion years, and have not stopped running. Yes, the features on the earth continue forming, volcanoes continue to erupt, and plates continue to move. That is what it looks like and that is what it is.

There is absolutely no evidence that it was all created 6000 years ago and then creation stopped. The bible deceives everyone. I am just asking why God wants that deception in His name?

Chët Andersen Is it? How do you know it's not a record of variation of created species?


Chët Andersen

Anthony McNally The answer depends on which of all the various theories of creation we want to analyze, but lets consider the standard biblical YEC where the universe is create at one point in time (a few days).

There are many way to measure the age of a mineral. These are based one well known natural processes that run at a known rate. For example, nuclear decay happens at very accurately measured rates. Crystals will include an element based on its chemical properties, but after nuclear decay the chemical properties of the atom are changed which is how we know that the original crystal would not have formed with that element in there.

There are several dozen of these "clocks" that can be used to measure the age of minerals. We see minerals piled into layers at well defined ages. If the layers were made all at once, (in a flood for instance) they would all have the same age. That is not what we see.

Then, we see certain fossils that always appear in layers of particular age. 99% of all species only appear in layers dated to long ago, and those species are not alive today.

It would be an extremely elaborate ruse for God to create all this at one point. Possible, but it would be fundamentally mendacious.
