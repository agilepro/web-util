    <h1>Web Utilities Index</h1>
</div>

<p>Here is a collection of useful pages for examining the web.
Some of these tools are useful for developing your web pages.
Also included are some tools for XML and web services debugging.
Please Enjoy!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="openid.jsp">OpenId Client Test</a> - Test that your
    OpenId provider is working correctly with an independent client.</li>

<li><a href="selectfile.jsp">XML Grinder</a> - Load XML in either
    by reading from a web URL, or by pasting from your text editor.
    This will parse the XML.  It will allow you
    to clean up, reformat, and validate the XML
    using S-XML (Simple XML) rules.</li>

<li><a href="sudoku.jsp">sudoku solver</a> - Fustrated by a
    particular SUDOKU puzzle?  Enter the starting values here
    and have the puzzle solved.  You can also play and make
    your own sudoku puzzle and see IF it can be solved.</li>

<li><a href="pagesource2.jsp">page source viewer</a> - This allows you to enter a
    URL and see exactly what the server sent.  There is no interpretation
    of JavaScript, there is no attempt to parse XML (and fail), there is
    no processing of redirect commands.  It simply reads that URL and display
    precisely what it receives. 
    (<a href="pagesource.jsp">old source viewer</a>)</li>

<li><a href="xmlstrip.jsp">XML Stripper</a> - Probably not what you
    are thinking.  This will take a block of XML and strip all
    occurrances of a particular tag from it.  This is useful in XPDL
    to remove all the ExtendedAttributes from an XPDL file.</li>

<li><a href="cleaner4.jsp">page cleaner</a> - Sometimes I am on a slow link,
    and the pages I am trying to browse through have an annoying amount of
    graphics and other large files attached.  What I want to do is to
    prevent the downloading of all the junk I am not going to look at, and
    focus instead on the textual content which is what I am looking for.
    This is an attempt to make a utility which strips out all the graphics
    and leaves just the text.  Scripts are disabled as well.  In some cases
    links can still be followed, and in other cases the links (and maybe
    even the entire page) will be broken.  This is actually not very useful
    in the current form, so I am looking for a better solution, but in some
    senses loading a page through the "cleaner" will be somewhat safer
    than loading it directly because it prevents a lot of the page side effects.</li>

<li><a href="hacker.jsp">URL Hacker</a> - paste a URL with a bunch of parameters
    and submit.  This will parse the URL parameters out, and make a form
    with all the parameters, as well as input fields where you can change
    the parameter values.  A button on that form allows you to access the
    original page, with the modified parameters.  This is really useful
    when the original URL has large and complexly encoded parameter values.</li>

<li><a href="threads.jsp">Threads</a> - produces a thread dump to show what tomcat is doing.</li>

<li><a href="utf8genie.htm">Unicode</a> - enter text and see the unicode and UTF-8 equivalents.</li>

<li><a href="latexgenie.htm">LaTeX</a> - enter text and see the LaTeX equivalents.</li>

<li><a href="format.jsp">Decimal Formatter</a> - experiment with decimal formatting in Java.</li>

<li><a href="path1/path2/fff/ggg.doc?s=3&y=4">HTTPRequest Helper</a> - demonstrating the various parts of the HTTP request path parsing.</li>

<li><a href="facebook.jsp">Facebook Experiment</a> - Facebook login and fetches.</li>

<li><a href="unbuilder.jsp">Unbuilder</a> - Look at output files and determine which source they came from.</li>
